**YANOTECH** (Yet ANOther TECHnical) is a blog I have decided to build using Github Pages and [Jekyll][jekyllrb].

[This blog][yanotech] will mostly contain technical posts that are relevant to a wide technical audience, from cloud technologies, dockerisation, or simple tips.

Most of the posts you will find here will be in English, but some of them will be in Spanish. For those, the category [Spanish (yanotech-es)][yanotech-es] will be built.

I will populate some posts here from my old blog [Memoria de Acceso Aleatorio][ram-blog], but this will be mostly about new content.

Cheers!
