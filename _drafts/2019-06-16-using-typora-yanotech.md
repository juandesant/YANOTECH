Thanks to Javier Arantegui ([@runjaj](https://twitter.com/runjaj "Javier Arantegui (@runjaj) in Twitter")), I've discovered [Typora][typora], a Markdown editor with customizable appearance and built-in support for features such as numbering, tables of contents, math, and most interestingly, [text-described diagrams][typora-diags].

[typora]: https://typora.io "Typora: a markdown editor/viewer supporting math and diagrams"
[typora-diags]: https://support.typora.io/Draw-Diagrams-With-Markdown/ "Typora: Draw diagramas with Markdown"

An example of sequence diagram that Typora can easily render —by leveraging [`js-sequence`](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/)— is the following:

~~~gfm
```sequence
client->server: client request
Note right of server: process request
server-->client: server response
```
~~~

which gives you:

```sequence
client->server: client request
Note right of server: process request
server-->client: server response
```

Please note that you need to use a *code fence* in order to show both the code **and** the graphic in the output that you're generating.

You can also use the power of [`flowchart.js`](https://flowchart.js.org/) to do flowcharts. Again, you need to use code fences to be able to display code, instead of symply executing it and getting the graphical representation. The Source Code mode of Typora is particularly useful for this.

In particular, this code
~~~gfm
```flow
st=>start: Start
op=>operation: Your Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?
e=>end

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```
~~~

gives you:

```flow
st=>start: Start
op=>operation: Your Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?
e=>end

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```

The diagrams can be exported to many of the formats supported by [Pandoc][pandoc]. In particular, Typora supports the following output formats (in alphabetic order):

* ePub
* HTML
* LaTeX
* MediaWiki
* Microsoft Word (.docx)
* OpenOffice 
* OPML
* PDF
* reStructuredText
* RTF
* Textile

This is an example of the output that can be generated by Typora:
